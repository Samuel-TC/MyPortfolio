                                Hello, my name is Samuel and I am a bachelor's student in business informatics 
                                at the University of Costa Rica, as well as a full stack web developer in training. 
                                I am passionate about programming and technology in general, and I really enjoy creating
                                attractive and functional web solutions that provide value to users.
                            </p>

                            <p style="font-size: 17px; margin: 1rem;" >
                                Ever since I discovered the world of programming, I have been working hard to develop my
                                skills in multiple programming languages and web development technologies, such as HTML,
                                CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and SQL databases. I like to work on 
                                challenging and exciting projects that allow me to apply what I have learned and continue
                                to improve my skills.
                            </p>
